## Original User Request:
Could you please design a modern and clean search engine results page for me, similar in style to webcrawler.com?

Here’s what I need:

A visually appealing and minimal search interface.

When a user searches for something, it should fetch the results from Google.

However, I want the results to appear as if they are coming from my website (not visibly redirected or showing they’re from Google).

Basically, I want users to feel like they are searching within my own platform, even though the results are pulled from Google in the background.
